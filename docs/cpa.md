# Cognitive Prompt Architecture (CPA)

## Definition

**Cognitive Prompt Architecture (CPA)** is a structured methodology designed to enhance large language model (LLM) performance by applying domain-specific cognitive strategies through prompts, without requiring model retraining. CPA comprises six distinct *domains of thought*—[Reasoning Cycle](#reasoning-cycle-explore-rc) (RC: Explore), [Adversarial Refinement](#adversarial-refinement-challenge-ar) (AR: Challenge), [Evolutionary Growth](#evolutionary-growth-evolve-eg) (EG: Evolve), [Dialectic Inquiry](#dialectic-inquiry-question-di) (DI: Question), [Panel Synthesis](#panel-synthesis-integrate-ps) (PS: Integrate), and [Constraint Dynamics](#constraint-dynamics-adapt-cd) (CD: Adapt)—each tailored to guide LLMs in solving complex tasks systematically. These domains are supported by a memory integration system that employs a three-layered memory bank[^1] to maintain context and facilitate continuous improvement through structured self-evaluation.

Each domain follows a standardized five-phase process—Problem Exploration & Solution Space Mapping, Detailed Analysis, Implementation & Verification, Self-Evaluation & Reward Calculation, and Knowledge Integration—to ensure rigorous problem-solving and measurable outcomes. CPA adapts established computational paradigms, including [Monte Carlo Tree Search](#background-paradigms-and-algorithms) (MCTS), [Markov Decision Processes](#background-paradigms-and-algorithms) (MDPs), and [temporal difference learning](#background-paradigms-and-algorithms) (TD Learning), into a prompt-driven framework for LLMs.

## Executive Summary

The Cognitive Prompt Architecture (CPA) is a powerful framework designed to enhance the problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) without requiring retraining. By structuring prompts around six distinct cognitive domains, CPA guides LLMs through systematic thinking processes that mirror human expert reasoning.

Key benefits of CPA include:

- **Enhanced Problem Exploration**: Systematically maps solution spaces and evaluates alternatives
- **Improved Solution Quality**: Applies critical thinking and adversarial analysis to identify weaknesses
- **Balanced Decision-Making**: Integrates multiple perspectives to create holistic solutions
- **Adaptive Problem-Solving**: Navigates constraints effectively through progressive refinement
- **Measurable Outcomes**: Includes built-in evaluation metrics for continuous improvement

CPA is particularly valuable for complex tasks requiring deep reasoning, such as software architecture design, strategic planning, and multi-faceted problem-solving. The framework's structured approach helps LLMs deliver more reliable, well-reasoned, and comprehensive solutions across diverse domains.

For machine learning applications, consider reviewing our [Foundation Questions](machine-learning/foundation-questions.md) guide to establish a clear understanding before applying CPA to your ML projects.

## Abstract

Cognitive Prompt Architecture (CPA) is a methodology that utilizes six cognitive domains—Reasoning Cycle, Adversarial Refinement, Evolutionary Growth, Dialectic Inquiry, Panel Synthesis, and Constraint Dynamics—to systematically improve LLM task performance without retraining. Supported by a structured memory bank system, CPA enables LLMs to explore solution spaces, evaluate approaches, implement solutions, and refine strategies through prompt-guided cognitive processes. CPA aims to achieve high-fidelity outcomes by integrating principles from reinforcement learning—such as Monte Carlo Tree Search, Markov Decision Processes, and temporal difference learning—into a scalable, prompt-based approach, advancing LLM reasoning and problem-solving capabilities.

## Background Paradigms and Algorithms

CPA incorporates the following computational paradigms and algorithms, adapted from reinforcement learning and decision theory, as foundational influences:

1.  **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**:
    -   *Definition*: A heuristic search algorithm that constructs a tree of possible actions and outcomes, using random sampling to evaluate decisions by balancing exploration and exploitation.
    -   *Role in CPA*: Provides a basis for iterative exploration and evaluation in domains like Reasoning Cycle and Evolutionary Growth.
    -   *Source*: See References [^2].

2.  **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**:
    -   *Definition*: A framework modeling decision-making as a sequence of states, actions, and rewards, where the next state depends only on the current state and action.
    -   *Role in CPA*: Underpins state-transition-based refinement in domains like Adversarial Refinement and Panel Synthesis.
    -   *Source*: See References [^3].

3.  **Temporal Difference Learning (TD Learning)**:
    -   *Definition*: A reinforcement learning method that updates value estimates incrementally based on the difference between predicted and actual rewards over time.
    -   *Role in CPA*: Drives heuristic refinement and learning integration in domains like Dialectic Inquiry and Constraint Dynamics.
    -   *Source*: See References [^4].

These paradigms are adapted into CPA’s prompt-driven structure, enabling LLMs to emulate RL-style reasoning.
***
## Evaluation Approach

**CPA utilizes two levels of evaluation**:
#### Cognitive Assessment
*   **Internal Domain Assessment:** Each domain's prompt template includes a self-evaluation section where 4 criteria (e.g., Accuracy, Efficiency, Process, Innovation) are scored from 1-10, totaling 40 points. This guides the structured thinking process *within* that domain.
#### Task Assessment
*   **Boundary Adherence Assessment:** The final output generated through the CPA process can be assessed against a rigorous standard that measures the quality, correctness, and efficiency of the completed work product based on rigidly defined criteria.

This separation allows for both process guidance within domains and quality assessment of the final outcome.

### Internal Domain Assessment Legend

- **Setting A Standard of Excellence:** ≥ 96% (≥ 38 / 40 points)
  *Represents near-perfect, exemplary performance expected from a top-tier foundational model.*

- **Great Performance – Approaching Excellence:** ≥ 94% (≥ 37.6 / 40 points)
  *Indicates very high-quality output, close to the excellence threshold.*

- **Good Job – Strive for Excellence:** ≥ 90% (≥ 36 / 40 points)
  *Meets the strict minimum standard; improvement is encouraged to reach excellence.*

- **Unacceptable for Foundation Model:** < 90% (< 36 / 40 points)
  *Fails to meet baseline quality; requires immediate remediation.*

This diagram illustrates how the six domains of CPA work together to transform a problem into an optimal solution. The process typically begins with Reasoning Cycle to explore the solution space, followed by specialized domains that refine, evolve, and question the approach. Finally, Panel Synthesis and Constraint Dynamics help integrate perspectives and adapt to constraints before arriving at the optimal solution.

-3: Produces a biased or unbalanced solution.
-2: Misses important gaps in analysis.
-1: Provides weak justification for synthesis.
```
#### Key Benefits of This Approach

This domain effectively simulates multi-perspective analysis and MDP concepts by:
1.  Explicitly defining and adopting distinct expert roles or viewpoints relevant to the problem (**Expert Perspectives**).
2.  Analyzing the problem and potential solutions through the lens of each defined perspective.
3.  Identifying conflicts and synergies between perspectives and synthesizing them into a cohesive solution (**Integration Phase**, akin to MDP reward modeling considering multiple state factors).
4.  Analyzing and documenting necessary trade-offs made during synthesis (**Trade-off Analysis**).
5.  Using the 0-100 scoring rubric within the prompt to evaluate the quality and balance of the synthesized solution.

The primary advantage is promoting holistic solutions that account for diverse requirements and constraints, reducing the risk of specialist tunnel vision, all through a structured prompt-driven process.

#### Target Topics
- System integration involving multiple components or APIs.
- Interdisciplinary design problems (e.g., balancing UX, performance, security).
- Collaborative project planning and requirements gathering.

### Constraint Dynamics: Adapt (CD)

**Description**: This domain employs **Constraint-Focused Progressive Refinement** to navigate complex problems by systematically manipulating constraints. Inspired by **Temporal Difference (TD) Learning**'s adaptive nature, it guides the LLM to identify, classify, relax, and progressively reintroduce constraints, thereby exploring the solution space dynamically and balancing limitations with opportunities.

#### Prompt Template
```markdown
**PROBLEM STATEMENT**: [Define the task requiring constraint adaptation.]

**Phase 1: Problem & Constraint Decomposition**
- **Identify Constraints**: [List all known constraints (technical, resource, time, etc.).]
- **Classify Constraints**: [Categorize each constraint (e.g., hard, soft, negotiable).]
- **Rank Constraints**: [Order constraints by importance/rigidity.]

**Phase 2: Constraint Relaxation & Ideal Solution**
- **Relax Constraints**: [Temporarily remove all but the absolute core constraints.]
- **Ideal Solution Design**: [Develop an optimal solution for the simplified, unconstrained problem.]
- **Justification**: [Explain why this solution is optimal in the relaxed state.]

**Phase 3: Progressive Constraint Addition & Adaptation**
- **Reintroduce Constraint 1**: [Add the most critical constraint back.]
  - Adaptation: [Modify the ideal solution to meet this constraint. Document impact.]
- **Reintroduce Constraint 2**: [Add the next most critical constraint.]
  - Adaptation: [Further modify the solution. Document impact.]
- *Continue adding constraints progressively.*

**Phase 4: Breaking Constraints & Final Implementation**
- **Critical Constraint Impact**: [Identify which constraint(s) most significantly limit the solution quality.]
- **Challenge Constraints (Optional)**: [Propose alternative approaches that might challenge or bypass key constraints.]
- **Final Constrained Solution**: [Present the solution adapted to all necessary constraints.]
- **IMPLEMENTATION**: [Detail the final solution process or pseudocode.]

**Phase 5: Evaluation & Knowledge Integration**
- **SELF-EVALUATION**: [Score each criterion 1-10]
  - Accuracy: [Score 1-10] - [Justify based on meeting requirements under constraints.]
  - Efficiency: [Score 1-10] - [Justify based on performance achieved within constraints.]
  - Process: [Score 1-10] - [Justify based on systematic constraint handling.]
  - Innovation: [Score 1-10] - [Justify based on creativity in adapting to constraints.]
  - Total Score: [Sum/40]

```
#### CD: Adapt - Internal Domain Assessment Criteria
```markdown
**Rewards**:
+10: Systematically identifies, classifies, and ranks all constraints.
+5: Designs an ideal solution under relaxed constraints.
+3: Skillfully adapts solution as constraints are reintroduced.
+2: Challenges and negotiates critical constraints creatively.
+2: Quantifies impact of each constraint on solution quality.

```
#### Key Benefits of This Approach

This domain effectively simulates adaptive problem-solving and TD Learning concepts by:
1.  Systematically identifying and classifying problem constraints (**Problem Decomposition**).
2.  Exploring an idealized solution space by temporarily removing constraints (**Constraint Relaxation**).
3.  Understanding the impact of limitations by incrementally adding constraints back (**Progressive Constraint Addition**, similar to TD's incremental learning).
4.  Identifying critical constraints and potentially challenging them (**Breaking Constraints**).
5.  Using the 0-100 scoring rubric within the prompt to evaluate how effectively constraints are managed and balanced.

The primary advantage is enabling flexible adaptation to complex, heavily constrained problems by systematically exploring the impact of limitations, often revealing non-obvious solution pathways or unnecessary self-imposed restrictions.

#### Target Topics
- Resource-constrained optimization (e.g., limited memory, CPU, power, bandwidth).
- Designing systems under strict security or regulatory requirements.
- Platform adaptation and cross-compatibility challenges.
- Problems requiring careful trade-offs between competing constraints.

#### Example Application
```markdown
**PROBLEM STATEMENT**: Optimize a mobile application for low-end devices in regions with limited connectivity.

**Phase 1: Problem & Constraint Decomposition**
- **Identify Constraints**:
  - Technical: Low RAM (512MB), slow processors, intermittent connectivity
  - Resource: Limited development budget, small team
  - User: Need for essential functionality even offline
- **Classify Constraints**:
  - Hard: Must work on 512MB RAM devices, must function offline
  - Soft: Response time, visual polish, feature completeness
- **Rank Constraints**: 1) Offline functionality, 2) Memory usage, 3) Battery efficiency

**Phase 2: Constraint Relaxation & Ideal Solution**
- **Relax Constraints**: Temporarily ignore memory, connectivity, and battery limitations.
- **Ideal Solution Design**: Full-featured progressive web app with real-time sync, rich UI, and comprehensive analytics.

**Phase 3: Progressive Constraint Addition & Adaptation**
- **Reintroduce Constraint 1**: Offline functionality
  - Adaptation: Implement offline-first architecture with local storage and sync queue.
- **Reintroduce Constraint 2**: 512MB RAM limit
  - Adaptation: Implement aggressive resource cleanup, limit in-memory cache, lazy load components.

## Implementation Guidance

While each CPA domain can be applied individually to solve specific types of problems, their true power emerges when they are combined strategically. Here are guidelines for implementing CPA effectively:

### Selecting the Right Domain

Choose the most appropriate domain based on the nature of your problem:

- **RC: Explore** - Best for problems requiring systematic exploration of multiple solution approaches.
- **AR: Challenge** - Ideal for solutions that need critical evaluation and strengthening against potential weaknesses.
- **EG: Evolve** - Effective for iterative development and improvement of solutions over multiple cycles.
- **DI: Question** - Powerful for uncovering hidden assumptions and exploring problems from first principles.
- **PS: Integrate** - Optimal for problems requiring balanced consideration of multiple stakeholder perspectives.
- **CD: Adapt** - Best for navigating heavily constrained problem spaces where trade-offs are necessary.

### Combining Domains

For complex problems, consider these effective domain combinations:

1. **Exploration → Refinement**: Begin with **RC: Explore** to map the solution space, then use **AR: Challenge** to strengthen the chosen approach.

2. **Question → Evolve**: Start with **DI: Question** to challenge assumptions, then apply **EG: Evolve** to iteratively improve the solution.

3. **Explore → Integrate → Adapt**: Use **RC: Explore** to identify approaches, **PS: Integrate** to balance perspectives, and **CD: Adapt** to navigate constraints.

4. **Full CPA Workflow**: For the most complex problems, follow the sequence illustrated in the domain relationships diagram:
   - Begin with **RC: Explore** to map the solution space
   - Apply **AR: Challenge**, **EG: Evolve**, and **DI: Question** in parallel to refine, evolve, and question the approach
   - Use **PS: Integrate** to synthesize insights from previous domains
   - Apply **CD: Adapt** to optimize the solution for real-world constraints

### Example: Software Architecture Design

To design a new microservice architecture:

1. Use **RC: Explore** to evaluate different architectural patterns (monolithic, microservices, serverless)
2. Apply **AR: Challenge** to identify security vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks
3. Implement **PS: Integrate** to balance perspectives of security, performance, and maintainability
4. Employ **CD: Adapt** to optimize the design for infrastructure constraints and budget limitations

By thoughtfully selecting and combining CPA domains, you can guide LLMs to produce more thorough, well-reasoned, and robust solutions to complex problems.
